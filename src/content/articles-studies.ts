## What Minimum Wage Is Really Worth in 2026

Minimum wage headlines always quote the hourly rate. But a $17.00 wage in one province and a $16.60 wage in another can leave a worker with almost the same money in the bank, because provincial taxes and payroll deductions differ sharply across Canada.

We ran every provincial and territorial minimum wage (current as of June 12, 2026) through the CanPay Insights tax engine to answer one question: **what does a full-time minimum wage worker actually keep?**

### Key findings

- **The national gap is $7,620 a year.** A full-time minimum wage worker in Nunavut takes home $34,098; in Alberta, $26,478.
- **Nova Scotia takes the biggest bite.** Deductions consume 19.8% of a minimum wage salary in Nova Scotia — the highest in Canada. Alberta takes the smallest share (15.1%), but its $15.00 wage is so low that Alberta workers still finish last in actual dollars.
- **PEI's higher wage mostly evaporates.** PEI's $17.00 wage is 40 cents above Quebec's $16.60, but after deductions the difference shrinks to about $36 a month.
- **Saskatchewan nearly catches Manitoba.** Saskatchewan pays 65 cents less per hour than Manitoba, but its lower deductions close the annual net gap to just $599.

### Full results: minimum wage take-home pay by province (June 2026)

Figures assume full-time hours (40 hours/week, 2,080 hours/year), basic personal amounts only, and 2025/2026 tax rates.

| Province | Min. wage | Gross (full-time) | Take-home / year | Take-home / month | Net hourly | Deduction rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Nunavut | $19.75 | $41,080 | **$34,098** | $2,842 | $16.39 | 17.0% |
| Yukon | $18.51 | $38,501 | **$31,580** | $2,632 | $15.18 | 18.0% |
| British Columbia | $18.25 | $37,960 | **$31,269** | $2,606 | $15.03 | 17.6% |
| Ontario | $17.60 | $36,608 | **$30,301** | $2,525 | $14.57 | 17.2% |
| Northwest Territories | $16.95 | $35,256 | **$29,404** | $2,450 | $14.14 | 16.6% |
| Prince Edward Island | $17.00 | $35,360 | **$28,464** | $2,372 | $13.68 | 19.5% |
| Quebec | $16.60 | $34,528 | **$28,038** | $2,336 | $13.48 | 18.8% |
| Nova Scotia | $16.75 | $34,840 | **$27,950** | $2,329 | $13.44 | 19.8% |
| Newfoundland and Labrador | $16.35 | $34,008 | **$27,547** | $2,296 | $13.24 | 19.0% |
| Manitoba | $16.00 | $33,280 | **$27,164** | $2,264 | $13.06 | 18.4% |
| New Brunswick | $15.90 | $33,072 | **$26,984** | $2,249 | $12.97 | 18.4% |
| Saskatchewan | $15.35 | $31,928 | **$26,565** | $2,214 | $12.77 | 16.8% |
| Alberta | $15.00 | $31,200 | **$26,478** | $2,206 | $12.73 | 15.1% |

*Deduction rate = (federal tax + provincial tax + CPP/QPP + EI, and QPIP in Quebec) as a share of gross pay.*

### The hourly rate you never see on the poster

Translating take-home pay back into an hourly figure shows how much of every advertised minimum wage hour a worker actually keeps:

- **Nunavut:** $19.75 advertised → **$16.39 in the bank**
- **Ontario:** $17.60 advertised → **$14.57 in the bank**
- **Quebec:** $16.60 advertised → **$13.48 in the bank**
- **Alberta:** $15.00 advertised → **$12.73 in the bank**

No Canadian jurisdiction lets a full-time minimum wage worker keep more than 85% of their gross pay.

### Why the deduction rates differ so much

At minimum wage income levels ($31,000–$41,000 a year), three things drive the differences:

1. **Provincial basic personal amounts.** Provinces with low basic personal amounts — PEI ($11,385) and Nova Scotia ($12,544) are among the lowest — start taxing income much earlier than Alberta ($22,783) or the territories, and Nova Scotia pairs that with the highest bottom-bracket rate in the country (8.79%).
2. **Quebec's separate system.** Quebec layers QPP (at a higher rate than CPP) and QPIP on top of income tax, partly offset by the federal Quebec abatement.
3. **CPP and EI are flat at this level.** CPP (5.95%) and EI (1.64%) apply almost uniformly, so they hit low earners proportionally harder than higher earners who exceed the contribution ceilings.

### Wage increases already scheduled for late 2026

Four provinces have announced October 1, 2026 increases that will shift these numbers:

- Ontario: $17.60 → $17.95
- Manitoba: $16.00 → $16.40
- Prince Edward Island: $17.00 → $17.30
- Nova Scotia: $16.75 → $17.00

We will update this study when the new rates take effect.

### Methodology

Calculations use the CanPay Insights tax engine with 2025/2026 federal and provincial tax brackets, CPP/CPP2 (QPP/QPP2 and QPIP for Quebec), and EI premiums. We assume a single worker, full-time hours (2,080 hours/year), no RRSP contributions, no benefits, and basic personal amounts only. Real paycheques will vary with credits, benefits, and actual hours. Minimum wage rates are current as of June 12, 2026, sourced from the [Government of Canada minimum wage database](https://minwage-salairemin.service.canada.ca/en/general.html) and provincial announcements.

You can verify any figure with our [free payroll calculator](/) or the province pages, for example [$35,000 after tax in Ontario](/35000-after-tax-ontario) and the [hourly wage calculator](/hourly-wage-calculator).

## What is CPP2?

If you earn a higher income, you may have noticed a new line on your pay stub: a second CPP contribution, often labelled **CPP2**. It is not an error — it is the final stage of the CPP enhancement that Canada has been phasing in since 2019.

Regular CPP takes 5.95% of your pensionable earnings up to the first ceiling. **CPP2 adds a second 4% contribution** on the slice of income between that first ceiling and a higher second ceiling. You only pay it if you earn above the first ceiling.

## CPP2 in 2025 vs 2026

The two ceilings have official names: the **YMPE** (Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings — the first ceiling) and the **YAMPE** (Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings — the second ceiling).

| | First ceiling (YMPE) | Second ceiling (YAMPE) | CPP2 rate | Max CPP2 (employee) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025 | $71,300 | $81,200 | 4% | ~$396 |
| 2026 | Higher (set by CRA) | Higher (set by CRA) | 4% | Slightly higher |

The CRA announces the new ceilings each autumn for the year ahead. The 4% rate stays the same — only the earnings bands move up with average wages.

## Who actually pays CPP2

- **Earning under the first ceiling** (~$71,300 in 2025): you pay **no CPP2** at all.
- **Earning between the two ceilings**: you pay 4% on the amount above the first ceiling.
- **Earning above the second ceiling**: you pay the full maximum CPP2, then contributions stop for the year.

So CPP2 is purely a higher-earner deduction. Someone on $60,000 never sees it; someone on $90,000 pays the full amount.

## What CPP2 costs you on each paycheque

Because CPP2 is capped, the most an employee pays in 2025 is roughly **$396 for the year** — about $15 per bi-weekly cheque if spread evenly. Your employer pays the same amount again. It is modest, but it stacks on top of regular CPP, EI, and income tax, which is why your take-home pay can feel lower than expected once your salary crosses the first ceiling.

## CPP2 vs regular CPP

| | Regular CPP | CPP2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rate (employee) | 5.95% | 4% |
| Applies to | $3,500 up to first ceiling | First ceiling up to second ceiling |
| Who pays | Almost all workers | Only higher earners |

Both are mandatory and both are matched by your employer. The upside: higher contributions today mean a larger CPP pension when you retire.

CPP2 is built into the CanPay Insights calculator. Enter your salary and province to see exactly how much CPP, CPP2, EI, and tax come off your pay for 2025 and 2026 — try the [free payroll calculator](/), or check a specific salary like [$90,000 after tax in Ontario](/90000-after-tax-ontario).
